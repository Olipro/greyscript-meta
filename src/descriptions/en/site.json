  "WELCOME_TEXT": "<p>Grey Hack enables players to create their own programs inside the game via the integrated scripting language called GreyScript. GreyScript is a fork of <a href=\"https://miniscript.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MiniScript</a> and can be compared to another language such as JavaScript or Lua.</p><p>Programs can be created within Grey Hack via the in-game CodeEditor. Alternatively you can also use <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Code</a> with <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ayecue.greybel-vs\" target=\"_blank\">greybel-vs</a> which includes syntax highlighting and other helpful features. Another alternative is to use the <a href=\"https://editor.greyscript.org\" target=\"_blank\">online editor</a> provided by <a href=\"https://github.com/ayecue/greybel-js\" target=\"_blank\">greybel-js</a>. The latter also provides a CLI which can be used for script execution outside the game and bundling of code files.</p><p>The best sources for Grey Hack scripts to get inspiration from are <a href=\"https://www.greyrepo.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\">greyrepo.xyz</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=grey+hack\" target=\"_blank\">github.com</a>.</p>",
